# Club Officers
### President: Me (Ryan Gaus)

<br/>
- We need to vote on a Vice President
  - I'm thinking we shouldn't have one, but a few - thoughts?
  - The position is for someone who is...
      - somewhat knowlegable in programming
      - comfortable with public speaking
  - You'll probably be presenting stuff (with my assistance, if you'd like) in front of the club.

<br/>
- *We're supposed to have a Treasurer, but there's no money involved so for now we'll omit? This is ok right?*

# Our first project: Our Website
- Take a look at it's current state - [`http://bakercs.github.io`](http://bakercs.github.io)
- Github Repository: [`http://github.com/bakercs/bakercs.github.io`](http://github.com/bakercs/bakercs.github.io)

- So... What do we want on it?

---
# Make a Fork
- Go to [`http://github.com/bakercs/bakercs.github.io`](http://github.com/bakercs/bakercs.github.io) in your
web browser
- Click on the "Fork" button in the upper right
- For more infomation, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bakercs/about/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) in `bakercs/about`

---
# Let's start coding!
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[YOUR USERNAME HERE]/bakercs.github.io
cd "bakercs.github.io"
```

Run `pwd` to get your current directory, and go to it in a file browser.

Make a copy of `index.html` and rename it to the page you're working on, so for
example, `sample-page.html`

Make whatever edits you'd like over the next week until the next meeting. Don't forget to update `partials/header.html` with a link to your new page!

After every signifigant change, make sure to:

```bash
  git add -u
  git commit -m "describe the changes you made, but no more than a sentence"
  git push origin master
```

---
# Think you're done?
You need to make a pull request to merge your changes back into the main code.
I've already explained this pretty well somewhere else so take a look at 
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bakercs/about/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) in 
`bakercs/about`.
