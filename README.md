Welcome to the first meeting of the Baker CS Club!
===
Hello, and Welcome! The Baker computer science club is perfect for anybody with a
further interest in computer science, but has some existing programming
experience. I've already planned out the first couple meetings, but after that
I'm purposely leaving it wide open for other's suggestions - I don't know what
other's are interested in. If you have any suggestions/comments, feel free to
talk to me. :+1:

[sample topic list](topics.md)

15 minutes of Git

1. Make a [Github account](http://github.com/join)
2. Add this organization to your account
3. Take a look at [try.github.io](http://try.github.io)
  - Make sure to look at the blue box in the lower left
    labeled `Advice` - it contains information that will help you
  - Don't worry about creating a Code School account (step 2 will ask you to)
