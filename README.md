Welcome to the Baker CS Club!
===
Hello, and Welcome! The Baker computer science club is perfect for anybody with a
further interest in computer science, but has some existing programming
experience. I've already planned out the first couple meetings, but after that
I'm purposely leaving it wide open for other's suggestions - I don't know what
other's are interested in. If you have any suggestions/comments, feel free to
talk to me. :+1:
