Baker Computer Science Club
===

The Baker computer science club is perfect for anybody with a further interest in
computer science, but has taken a programming language in school already.

Git
---
The club will start out with learning Git for managing code, and Github - both
of these tools are used extensively inside some of the best-known companies,
such as Google, Facebook, Netflix, Android, and more.

Project
---
I'm thinking that the club could form groups and work on some of their own
ideas. Anything goes - no idea is a bad one. People can work on whatever code
they want. Each group puts their project on Github for collaboration, and by
doing this, the club can contribute to an open-culture.

Hackathon
---
Sometime in late April, we'll have an event where everyone presents their
project(s), so they can show off all that they have achieved. This kind of event
is known as a hackathon and I can speak from personal experience that it is a
really cool experience that anybody interested in computer science should take
part in.
